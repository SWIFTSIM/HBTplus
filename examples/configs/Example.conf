[================================== FILE PATHS ================================]

# Path to the files containing the particle information. They should contain
# their coordinates velocities and masses. If thermal unbinding is enabled, the
# thermal energy of gas is also required.
SnapshotPath

# Path to the files containing information used to reconstruct the FoF group
# membership of particles.
HaloPath

# Base name for the snapshot files, e.g. <SnapshotFileBase>_<snap_nr>.
SnapshotFileBase

# Base name for the directories where snapshot subfiles are saved, if
# applicable. For example,
# <SnapshotDirBase>_<snap_nr>/<SnapshotFileBase>_<snap_nr>.<subfile_nr>. If
# there is only one file per snapshot, omit this option.
SnapshotDirBase

# Base directory of where the HBT catalogues will be saved. The HBT catalogue
# for each snapshot is saved in its own subdirectory, with the number of
# subfiles matching the number of MPI ranks.
SubhaloPath

# The minimum and maximum snapshot number of the simulation being analysed. If
# 10 snapshots exist, and they are 0-indexed, the values would correspond to 0
# and 9, respectively.
MinSnapshotIndex 0
MaxSnapshotIndex

# Which subset of snapshots to analyse, if applicable. For example, if we only
# want to analyse every second snapshot of a ten snapshot run: 1 3 5 7 9.

[=================================== FILE IO ==================================]

# The format used by files containing the particle information.
SnapshotFormat

# The format used by the files containing the FoF memberships of particles.
GroupFileFormat

# The value in the FoF particle membership catalogue that corresponds to
# belonging to no FoF group.
ParticleNullGroupId

# If particles split in the simulation, in which case their splitting history
# needs to be provided. This is only implemented for SWIFT hydrodynamical 
# simulations.
ParticlesSplit

# If the position, velocity, mass and type of particles should be saved
# alongside the subhalo catalogues. If thermal unbinding is enabled, it is also
# saved. This information is only provided for particles that are bound to a
# subhalo.
SaveBoundParticleProperties 0

# If the internally calculated binding energies of particles should be saved
# alongside the subhalo catalogues. This is only provided for particles that are
# bound to a subhalo.
SaveBoundParticleBindingEnergies 0

[==================================== UNITS ===================================]

# What units should be used. They should always be provided, either through
# these configuration paramters, or even better, directly loaded from the
# snapshot metadata.

VelInKmS     -1

[================================ SIMULATION BOX ==============================]

# How many particles a subhalo can have associated to its source subhalo,
# relative to its number of bound particles.

# Maximum number of particles used to estimate the gravitational potential of
# particles. If the subhalo has more than this value, a randomly selected
# MaxSampleSizeOfPotentialEstimate particles are used as gravity sources.
MaxSampleSizeOfPotentialEstimate 1000

# If the self-binding energy of the most bound subset of particles should be
# computed after unbinding the subhalo. This step is done to better identify the
# most bound particle if potential subsampling was enabled. Not enabling this
# could make HBT incorrectly identify which particle is the most bound.
RefineMostBoundParticle 1

# Fraction of the most bound particles whose self-binding energies are computed
# to better estimate the most bound particle. The actual value is
# max(MaxSampleSizeOfPotentialEstimate, BoundFractionCenterRefinement).
BoundFractionCenterRefinement 0.1

[=============================== SUBHALO TRACKING =============================]

# Particle types that can be used as subhalo tracers. Tracers are used to
# identify which FoF group hosts a given subhalo, the offsets in phase-space
# between subhaloes, and the position/velocity of orphan (disrupted) subhaloes.
# We recommend using time-persistent, collisionless particles (e.g. DM & stars).
TracerParticleTypes 1 4

# Minimum number of bound particles required for a subhalo to be resolved,
# regardless of their particle type.

# Minimum number of bound tracer particles required for a subhalo to be
# resolved. Since tracers are used to trace subhaloes, at least one should be
# present.

# How many tracer particles are used to identify the host FoF group of

# FoF. Expressed relative to the most massive subhalo in said host FoF group.
MajorProgenitorMassRatio 0.8

# Keeping here as a reference as it is defined, but it is not used internally at
# the moment. It will be good to add as an additional option when computing the
# phase-space distance between overlapping subhaloes. The current behaviour is
# equivalent to SubCoreSizeMin = 10 and SubCoreSizeFactor=0.
# SubCoreSizeMin 20
# SubCoreSizeFactor 0.25

# dataset is specified within the snapshot file.

# Whether to create a hash map to retrieve particle properties given an ID.
ParticleIdNeedHash 1

# Hexadecimal mask indicating which digits of the particle IDs are significant.
# For example, if only the first 4 digits are required (i.e. "1111" in binary),
